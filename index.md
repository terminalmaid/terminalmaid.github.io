# welcome to my website!
it's quite barebones, but after spending hours fucking around with hugo and jekyll i decided to settle on simple markdown. 

i'm terminalmaid and i enjoy minecraft a lot, i currently host a public modded anarchy server (here's the discord btw https://discord.gg/cAPkZUhA8n), and i also script in bash.

i'm currently trying to learn java to mod minecraft (because yes), and kaupenjoe's tutorials are quite helpful.

i also might start posting some content from my server on my youtube channel (https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCOHGrQf_8o57I9hg0G1DSrA) a bit later.
