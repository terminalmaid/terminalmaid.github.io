# welcome to my website!
it's quite barebones, but after spending hours fucking around with hugo and jekyll i decided to settle on simple markdown cuz why not. this page is just a about-me/q&a page about both me and linux

# who tf am i
i'm terminalmaid and i enjoy minecraft a lot, i currently host a public modded anarchy server ([discord link](https://discord.gg/cAPkZUhA8n)), and i also script in bash. i also enjoy shitposting.

# my videos
i might start posting some content from my server on my youtube channel ([link](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCOHGrQf_8o57I9hg0G1DSrA)) a bit later.

# is linux for hackers?
no, it's perfect for normal people too but it depends on what you do, video and photo editors might find linux hard to use but for most people it's the same thing but free. linux might be associated with hacking because it's way easier to use for those things but its just another stereotype mostly

# are all linux users femboy maids?
no, i'm not one either, i'm just doing it for the memes and stereotype
though this is funny as hell [gentoo speedrun femboy edition](https://youtu.be/uqrqbk93v5Y)

# am i sleep deprived
yes.
